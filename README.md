# SNP Frequency Analysis 

This project analyzes the frequency and statistical significance of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) using a public dataset derived from the PheGenI database.

Quick access: [Download CSV file (`PheGenI.csv`)](./PheGenI.csv)

## Dataset Source

The dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle**:  
[Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dsanr1/phenotype-genotype-integrator)

The Kaggle copy is built from the original NCBI PheGenI database and contains SNP-trait associations with P-values, gene names and chromosome numbers


## üìÇ Project files

| File | Purpose |

## Visualisations

1. **SNP count per chromosome** (X & Y included)  
2. **Top-10 traits** by SNP count  
3. **Histogram of ‚àílog<sub>10</sub>(P-Value)** for significance distribution  
4. **Missing-value summary** for the `P-Value` column  

Figures can be regenerated by running `temp.py`.

## Tech stack

- Python 3.11  
- pandas  
- matplotlib & seaborn  
- (optional) Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

### Summary
1Ô∏è‚É£ SNPs by Chromosome

![SNPs by Chromosome](./figures/snp_by_chromosome.png)

- Chromosomes **1, 6, and 19** contain the **highest number of SNPs**, suggesting regions with high genetic variability or dense gene areas.
- Chromosome **X** shows fewer SNPs compared to autosomes, and **chromosome Y** has the **lowest SNP count**, which is expected due to its smaller size and gene content.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Traits Associated with SNPs

![Top 10 Traits](./figures/top10_traits.png)

- The most common traits linked to SNPs include **Height**, **Schizophrenia**, **Body Mass Index (BMI)**, and **Type 2 Diabetes**.
- This suggests that these complex traits have a strong genetic basis and are highly studied in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Distribution of SNP Significance (‚àílog‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(P-Value))

![P-Value Distribution](./figures/pvalue_distribution.png)

- The majority of SNPs have P-values between **1e-7 and 1e-5**, indicating **strong but not extreme significance**.
- The histogram is right-skewed, and some SNPs have **extremely low P-values (< 1e-20)**, pointing to highly significant associations.

## üìå Conclusion

This analysis demonstrated how to:
- Clean and filter real SNP data
- Visualize genomic distribution across chromosomes
- Identify top phenotypic traits associated with SNPs
- Interpret significance levels through P-Value transformation

The approach is beginner-friendly, but applicable in real-world GWAS preprocessing and exploration.
