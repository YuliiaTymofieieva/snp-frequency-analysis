# SNP Frequency Analysis 

This project analyzes the frequency and statistical significance of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) using a public dataset derived from the PheGenI database.

Quick access: [Download CSV file (`PheGenI.csv`)](./PheGenI.csv)

## Dataset Source

The dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle**:  
[Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dsanr1/phenotype-genotype-integrator)

The Kaggle copy is built from the original NCBI PheGenI database and contains SNP-trait associations with P-values, gene names and chromosome numbers


## What I learned from this project
| **1. Understanding the data** | Explored real-world SNP information (`Chromosome`, `Trait`, `SNP rs`, `Gene`, `P-Value`). Practiced inspecting, cleaning and selecting features. |
| **2. Biological questions answered** | â€¢ Which chromosomes carry the most SNPs? <br>â€¢ Top traits with the highest SNP counts. <br>â€¢ Presence of missing significance values. <br>â€¢ Distribution of SNP significance via âˆ’log<sub>10</sub>(P-Value). |
| **3. Technical skills used** | `pandas` for data wrangling, grouping and counting. `matplotlib/seaborn` for visualisation. Calculated âˆ’log<sub>10</sub>(P-Value) to visualise significance. |

## Visualisations

1. **SNP count per chromosome** (X & Y included)  
2. **Top-10 traits** by SNP count  
3. **Histogram of âˆ’log<sub>10</sub>(P-Value)** for significance distribution  
4. **Missing-value summary** for the `P-Value` column  

Figures can be regenerated by running `temp.py`.
